## Responsibilities

- Led the sub-project focused on predicting sudden public safety incidents using agent-based modelling (ABM).
- Researched various scenarios, including mass evacuations, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters (fires and floods).
- Developed and applied big data algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
