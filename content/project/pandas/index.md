This project aimed to investigate intelligent collaborative social governance's evolutionary mechanisms and operational systems. Through quantitative characterisation and modelling methods, it investigated goal decomposition in intelligent social governance, explored the evolutionary mechanisms of multidimensional interactions, constructed models for entity state transitions and behavioural learning, and simulated the dynamic equilibrium processes of network structures and social rules.
