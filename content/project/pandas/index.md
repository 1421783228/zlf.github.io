This project aimed to investigate intelligent collaborative social governance's evolutionary mechanisms and operational systems. Through quantitative characterisation and modelling methods, it investigated goal decomposition in intelligent social governance, explored the evolutionary mechanisms of multidimensional interactions, constructed models for entity state transitions and behavioural learning, and simulated the dynamic equilibrium processes of network structures and social rules.

## Responsibilities

- Explored the evolution of intelligent social entity states and behaviours through autonomous learning driven by complex interactions and objectives
- Constructed and simulated dynamic mechanisms of complex structures in simulated intelligent societies' symbiotic information networks
- Investigated the computational framework for extrapolating intelligent societies, including constructing multi-level hierarchical optimisation models and investigating collaborative training methods

## Methods

### Modelling and Simulation
- Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
- System Dynamics

### Data Analysis
- Evolutionary Game Theory
- Complex Network Dynamics
