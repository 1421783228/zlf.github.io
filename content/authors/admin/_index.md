  #    summary: |
  #      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently working as a research assistant at the Computational Social Science Research Center at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). Prior to this, I pursued a Master's degree in Sociology at Central South University, where I conducted research in computational sociology under the guidance of [Prof. Peng L√º](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/lvpeng/zh_CN/index.htm). Additionally, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Labor and Social Security from Shanxi University, where I received multiple academic honors.

My main research interests lie in generative artificial intelligence, computational social science, intelligent social governance, social simulation systems, and emergency management, with a particular focus on Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). I also have a solid background in computational social science and data analysis, and I am passionate about applying these methods interdisciplinarily to research in the humanities and social sciences. Currently, my research focuses on generative artificial intelligence and generative agents, and I am actively exploring the transition from the traditional ABM paradigm to the Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) paradigm driven by large language models.
