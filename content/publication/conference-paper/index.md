  This paper investigates the impact of personal experience and social learning strategies on crowd evacuation during vehicle-ramming attacks. The research employs an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate evacuation processes based on the 2016 Berlin truck attack. The study compares evacuation outcomes using these two strategies, considering various factors such as death and injury rates, evacuation times, and the role of information dissemination.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Key findings include:</strong>
  <br><br>
  Social Learning Reduces Deaths: The social learning strategy, where individuals learn from others' evacuation paths, significantly reduces the number of deaths. This is because it allows people to respond more quickly and evacuate more efficiently by following others' paths to safety.

  Increased Injuries with Social Learning: Although fewer people die under the social learning strategy, the number of injuries increases due to higher crowd density on popular evacuation paths, leading to collisions and stampedes.

  Evacuation Time: The social learning strategy, particularly in its full form (plenary learning), reduces the evacuation time compared to personal experience-based evacuation. However, the evacuation time difference between partial learning and personal experience is less significant.

  Optimal Social Learning Proportion: The study identifies an optimal proportion of social learners (around 60%), which balances reductions in deaths and injuries, improving evacuation efficiency.

  Path Dynamics: The number of social learners influences the dynamics of evacuation paths. A higher proportion of social learners leads to longer, wider, and more distinct paths, facilitating faster evacuations.
  <br><br>
  The paper highlights the importance of balancing speed and safety during evacuations, showing that while social learning can accelerate evacuation and save lives, it also raises the risk of injury. The study calls for incorporating these findings into urban planning and emergency response strategies to improve crowd safety during emergencies.
