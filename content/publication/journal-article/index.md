  This paper investigates professional rescue strategies for high-rise building fires through agent-based modeling (ABM), using the Grenfell Tower fire as a case study. The research explores how different rescue strategies, such as the "stay-put" tactic and firefighter distribution, impact casualties and the number of rescued individuals during such fires. The study constructs a 3D ABM simulation, modeling both internal evacuation behaviors and external rescue operations to simulate realistic scenarios.

  <strong>Key findings include:</strong>
  <br><br>
  Stay-put Tactic: The stay-put strategy, where residents remain in place during a fire, leads to higher casualties. This finding supports previous research questioning the efficacy of this approach in modern high-rise buildings.

  Rescue Strategy Optimization: The number of firefighters involved in life-saving tasks significantly affects the outcomes. Increasing the proportion of firefighters assigned to rescue operations leads to a reduction in fatalities and injuries.

  Aerial Ladder Impact: The height and arrival time of aerial ladders influence rescue effectiveness. Aerial ladders reaching higher floors and arriving sooner increase the number of lives saved, though premature deployment can disrupt residents' self-evacuation efforts.

  Firefighter Coordination: A strategy prioritizing life-saving tasks over fire suppression proves more effective in saving lives, highlighting the need for optimized coordination among rescue teams.

  The paper emphasizes the importance of adjusting professional rescue strategies based on fire dynamics to enhance evacuation outcomes and reduce casualties.
